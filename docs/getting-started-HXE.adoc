# Getting Started with Hana Express on RHEL 7

## Get the required RHEL subscription
To install HANA on Red Hat Enterprise Linux you need some additional packages
which come in a special repository. To get this repository you need to have one
of the following products:

 - RHEL for SAP Solutions (premium, standard, developer Edition)
 - RHEL for Business Partner NFRs

The quickest way to achieve this is a personal developer edition of RHEL for
SAP solutions. Go to https://developers.redhat.com/products/sap/download/
register as a developer and download the developer edition from there

- Registration Link (http://developers.redhat.com/register) :
  Here you can either register a new personal account or link an already existing
  **personal** Red Hat Network account to it.
- Download Link (https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.2/x86_64/product-software):
  Here you can download the Installation DVD for RHEL with your previously registered
  account

*NOTE:* This is a regular RHEL installation DVD as RHEL for SAP Solutions is no additional
 product but only a special bundling. The subscription grants you access to the additional
 packages through our content delivery network(CDN) after installation.

## Download Hana Express
HANA Express is a reduced Version of SAP HANA and requires less resources than
HANA Platform Edition. It lacks at least the following features:

- Smart Data Integration (SDI)
- Smart Data Streaming
- Sytem Replication (HSR)
- Dynamic tiering

for a full list see http://news.sap.com/germany/files/2017/01/SAP-HANA-Express-Edition-FAQ-extern.pdf[the HANA Express FAQ]

For this quickstart guide you need to download the Binary installer method as described in detail
on this page: https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hxe-ua-installing-binary.html

In a nutshell, you need to do the followind

1. Register for Hana Express at https://www.sap.com/sap-hana-express
2. Install and start the download manager for on-premise install
3. Select Platform: Linux/x86 and Image: Binary installer
4. Select Server-Only installer (this is the only one required for this quickstart)
5. Click the download button (it downloads hxe.tgz)

## Install and Configure your RHEL server

If you are new to Red Hat and want to install it as a guest on your local system,
we have some handy http://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/get-started/[Getting Started guides]
 to walk you through it â€“ for bare metal or a hypervisor on Windows, MacOS, or another Linux.

### Minimum Requirements
Test environments are typically on virtual machines. The minimum requirement
to install Hana Express on RHEL is

- 2 cores (4 recommended)
- 16 GB of memory (server only) or 32GB (server + applications)
- 32GB swapspace (for 16GB instllation)
- 120GB diskspace

### Disk Layout
For a test system the disk layout is not really important. You may have
everything in / or maybe you want to do a separate partition for /hana that
should have the size of 2.5-3x main memory.

Create a sparse disk of 120GB and install everything in here with the following layout:

 # df -h
 Filesystem                    Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
 /dev/mapper/rhel_saphxe-root   86G  994M   81G   2% /
 devtmpfs                      7.9G     0  7.9G   0% /dev
 tmpfs                         7.9G     0  7.9G   0% /dev/shm
 tmpfs                         7.9G  8.4M  7.9G   1% /run
 tmpfs                         7.9G     0  7.9G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
 /dev/vda1                    1014M  122M  893M  12% /boot
 tmpfs                         1.6G     0  1.6G   0% /run/user/0

### Installation
Install your RHEL server on this virtual machine. If you are new to RHEL follow the
installation instructions at http://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/get-started/

Please change your disklayout according to the recommendations above. For this
tutorial the core installation is sufficient

Once you have installed RHEL follow these addtional steps:

1. register your fresh installed RHEL

 # subscription-manager register --auto-attach
 Registering to: subscription.rhsm.redhat.com:443/subscription
 Username: ********
 Password: 

2. subscribe to the required channels (Note: For HANA Express EUS or E4S channels are not required)
 
  # subscription-manager repos --disable="*" --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms --enable=rhel-sap-hana-for-rhel-7-server-rpms


3. install the following packages

  # yum install git ansible

4. Clone the HANA setup repository
  
  # git clone https://github.com/rhmk/ansible-hana-sysprep.git 

5. Unpack the previously downloaded hana express package

  # mkdir /install
  # cd /install 
  # tar xzvf hxe.tgz

6. configure and run the SAP playbook

7. verify your installation
